summary: For our sophomore engineering project, our team designed, built, and programmed a robot that can autonomously navigate its way to the center of a maze in ~1 minute. We finished 3rd out of 13 teams and 1st out of sophomores.

## Introduction
Micromouse is an internationally recognized competition where robot "mice" race to solve a 16x16 cell maze in the shortest time possible. Events are held worldwide and at varying levels. At the very top is the international competition where the mice go so fast that it becomes a task just to keep up with their movement (imagine <5 second solves). Unfortunately, our mouse was not fast enough to compete at this level. Instead, it competed at the collegiate level with mice from other [IEEE Region 6 schools](http://ieee-region6.org/).

## Rules
Although the rules may differ slightly depending on the region and level of competition, the basic rules are:
- The mouse must navigate the maze autonomously, meaning there must be no help from the contestant.
- The time for a run starts when the mouse leaves the start cell and stops when the mouse enters the center. Upon reaching the center, the mouse must return back to the start cell in order to perform another run.
- Contestants may perform as many runs as he/she can fit within a certain time limit (typically 10 minutes).
- If contestants touch the mouse before it makes it back to the start cell, then a penalty shall be assessed (typically an additional 30 seconds to the best run time).
You can read the full rules at the [Micromouse USA website](http://micromouseusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAMC2016Rules.pdf).
