## Previous Experience
Lucky to say, ICS 314 isn't the first time I've laid eyes on JavaScript. It was actually during my co-op tour with AMD that I was tasked to design a webtool and had to learn JavaScript, but more on that later. Anyway, JavaScript is a language and arguably, the language for the web. As a computer engineering major, I haven't had any previous exposure to JavaScript from school, so that co-op was really the first time I've seen and used it. So now the question is, what do I think of it?

## What I thought of JavaScript
When I was first learning JavaScript as a language, it was really easy. I don't mean to toot my own horn but the notion that once you learn a programming language, you (at least) know the basics of all of them. This is mostly true of my experiences with it as it was really easy to learn as I had previous experience with C and C++. A quick Google search to resolve any specific issues like what the function is to splice a string and that's usually sufficient enough to get me going. Anyways, at the end of my co-op tour, I thought that JavaScript was a really fun language to use. I loved the idea that anyone with a browser (minus the handful of people still on IE7) could see my projects without downloading or installing anything. Despite all this, there were some aspects of JavaScript that I really disliked.

## Frameorks
NodeJS, React, Angular, names that I've all heard of, but have no idea what they actually are nor do I have an idea of what they do. My only knowledge of them is that they're frameworks and that a lot of people use them. What's the problem? I think it's just the sheer number of frameworks. Some people like variety, but I'm the type of person that likes to be limited in choices.
