## Intro to the web
About two or three years ago, I wanted to learn web development. I don't remember the reason, but I think it might have had something to do with me wanting to learn new languages. At the time, I knew **nothing** about web development, but after consulting with Google, it seemed like HTML was the way to start.

## Bare HTML
My first steps to learning web development involved *just* HTML. I downloaded an app called "Learn HTML" which gave me enough information to start building simple websites. I remember creating pages with very square-ish layouts and boxy elements, similar to the websites you'd see back in the late 1990s.

<div class="ui raised compact segment">
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980509035420/http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" title="View on WayBack Machine">
    <div class="ui large blue ribbon label">
      Apple's website in the late 1990s
    </div>
    <img class="ui image" src="../images/apple-old-website.png">
  </a>
</div>

I realized I could've been a web designer at Apple, I was just 20 years too late. Anyway, when creating my bare-HTML websites, I would use inline styles for everything since that was all I knew. This worked fine for simple layouts, but when I tried to make more complex ones, things got **really** messy. It also didn't help that I was using *tables* for my layout (we all did at one point...right?). At that point, I knew I needed an upgrade, and that upgrade was CSS.
