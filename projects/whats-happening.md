## Motivation
For college students, finding events can be hard. Finding events that you're actually interested in, can be even harder. Here's an example.

Try finding the flier for the film festival. It's not very obvious, is it?

The same goes for those looking to advertise their events. Having to compete against all the other fliers makes it a less-than-ideal situation for getting your event publicity.

## Introduction
