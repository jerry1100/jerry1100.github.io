# Overview
Parking at the University of Hawai'i is limited. Furthermore, just getting to university is a task in itself because of the heavy congestion drivers face.

## The problem
Parking is limited and can be expensive. Not everyone can get a regular parking pass, as they are prioritized by class standing. However, there is a carpool pass, which functions similarly to a regular pass, except during peak hours, the driver has to be accompanied by other riders.

## The solution
The solution is to match drivers with carpool passes with riders who are along the way. This will benefit both the driver as he/she now essentailly has a regular parking pass, and it benefits the riders because they no longer need to commute themselves. Furthermore, this benefits the entire community as it reduces the number of cars on the road, leading to less congestion and thus, faster commutes.

* A login page where UH students and staff login with their credentials
* A menu where you can either post (as a driver looking for riders) or search (as a rider searching for a driver)
    *
